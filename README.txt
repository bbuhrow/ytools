This is a library of some common algorithms that I often find myself needing; 
for mathematical puzzles, analysis tools, and other applications.
Contains portable and simple but effective routines for:
* Timing
* Random number generation
* Hashing
* Memory allocation
* Computer feature identification
* Sorting
* Searching 
* Logging
* Combinatorics
* Queue/Stack storage on the heap
* A threadpool using either pthreads or Windows synchronization functions
** user-supplied dispatching and syncronization functions
** arbitrary number of work functions
